#After setting up the index.html file and select "main" under branches in "Pages" in settings of the repository, you would see brown color dot right near your account name i.e. freegggg0705 in the front page of the repository. Wait for it to turn green then your repository html would be host successfully.

#About adding image to your github pages:<br />
1.Upload your index.html<br />
2.Create a directory with name same with the asset content folder of your html file with random .md file as start(reference of creation of folder below)<br />
3.Add files to the directory.<br />
P.S.embedding of pdf (singlefile embedded works, unlike others. Try in expert-guide repos) or html or text file is a function in notion only. <br /> 
Files not work would only be shown as a downloadable link in the html host in github


#About how to create folder in github: Simply click to create new file then in the name you type in your folder name with"/" at the end. Then you have to first create a file since "Git doesn't recognize empty directories" <br />
